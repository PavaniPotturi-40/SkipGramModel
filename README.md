# Skip-gram with Negative Sampling on Wikipedia

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)** from scratch and trains it on a Wikipedia text dump.  
The learned word embeddings are compared with **Gensim’s Word2Vec** model using cosine similarity.  
Further, the embeddings are evaluated using **word analogy tasks** and analyzed for **social bias**, as discussed in Chapter 5.
